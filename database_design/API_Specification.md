`orderItem` is not an endpoint, it's a snapshot of the exact item and it's specifications at time it's placed.  
We want to preserve this as item specifications can change over time.
What you typically **embed** in `orderItem`
| Field     | Purpose                                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `product` | Reference to the original product (ObjectId) |
| `name`    | Product name at time of purchase             |
| `image`   | Image URL at time of purchase                |
| `price`   | Price when ordered                           |
| `qty`     | Quantity purchased                           |  

Example orderItem **(embedded)**
```
{
  "_id": "order1",
  "user": "user77",
  "orderItems": [
    {
      "product": "productId88",       // Reference for tracking or future lookup
      "name": "Shirt",        
      "image": "/images/shirt.jpg",
      "price": 29.99,             
      "qty": 2                        
    }
  ],
  "totalPrice": 59.98,
  "createdAt": "2025-05-20T10:00:00Z"  
}  
```  
Example orderItem **(referenced)**
```
{
  "_id": "order1",
  "user": "user77",
  "orderItems": [      // id's of individual orders
    "orderItemA1", 
    "orderItemA2"
  ],
  "totalPrice": 59.98,
  "createdAt": "2025-05-20T10:00:00Z"

MongoDB gives us **`Embedded`** or **`Referenced`** to associate our collections  
| Feature          | **Embedded**                       | **Referenced**                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Relationship  | Stored *inside* parent document    | Separate documents, linked via ObjectId  |
| Performance   | Faster reads (fewer queries/joins) | Slightly slower reads (requires lookup)  |
| Use Case      | One-to-few, tightly related data   | One-to-many, loosely related or reusable |
| Updates       | Updated *with* the parent          | Updated *independently*                  |
| Document Size | Grows with embedded array          | Smaller, normalized parent               |
| Best For       | Static data, doesn't change often  | Dynamic, shared across collections       |
| Avoid When     | Sub-document size grows unbounded  | You only ever use the data *with* parent |  

One case where we would want Referenced would be reviews.  
Looking up expanded reviews would be costly for performance.
